# TicTacToe in C++
Got bored and decided it would be a good idea to learn C++, decided to make TicTacToe, got to learn a bunch from doing it so that's cool.

## Running the program
```bash
clang++ tictactoe.cpp -o tictactoe
./tictactoe
```

## TODO (someday)
Play against AI mode, 2 types, random and unbeatable
